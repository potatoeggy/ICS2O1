 - playsound.py is an external cross-platform module for audio since winsound only works on Windows :/
 - My program isn't very user-friendly. Press Escape to exit during the animation if necessary.
 - Accepted config codes include 'default', 'full', 'epilepsy', 'marine', 'original', and 'empty'.
     - 'default' is the default cat
     - 'full' is all features added
     - 'epilepsy' is default cat + epilepsy on
     - 'marine' is kelp, ground, bubbles, and starfish along with a lighter background.
     - 'truemarine' is the above but without the rainbow on the cat
     - 'empty' is just the cat
     - 'original' is just the cat and rainbow



 - Try the Konami code while in the screen to enter a config code :)

 - Enjoy!
