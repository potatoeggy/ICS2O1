 - Created by Mehra Shariati + Daniel Chen
 - You can use right arrow to skip the first ~three seconds where it tells you to press escape to pause
 - You can pause virtually anywhere
 - EXP in the pause menu is only updated after a scene ends
 - Click on objects to gain Exploration Points, which determine your ending
     - clickable objects are:
         - Sun in desert
         - two right-most flowers in forest
         - all moving kelp centres except for the second-most one from the right in ocean
         - all fish in ocean (if you can reach their hitbox)
         - total 11 clickable items (realistically 8 considering fish hitbox)
         - 5 or more are needed to get the space ending
 - if a specific scene is needed you can modify the "transition" and "exp" variables at the bottom of the script just before the while loop to choose a scene
 - a lot of the code is to handle interactivity (mostly pausing) to it may get boring
